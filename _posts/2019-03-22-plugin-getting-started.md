ARGOS-LABS RPA+ have open architecture using Plugin.
This guide is the `Getting Started Guide` with ARGOS-LABS RPA+ plugin.

Once you finish this simple plugin guide you can build your own plugin.
This plugin program is not only for ARGOS-LABS RPA+ but can be used any kind of purpose as general CLI program.

# Running Environments

Plugin can be developed in Windows, Linux or Mac. However this guide is built these environments:

* OS: Windows 10 Pro
* Prerequsite Programs:
	* Python interpreter 3.7.x
	* PyCharm CE IDE

PyCharm and Python interpreter support Linux and Mac also, You can build this environment in Mac or Linux.

> Our plugin manager and SDK is made by Python programming language. So the environments are familiar to most of python programmer.

* Just click `Close` button.

![00140 python setup finish](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00140.png)

* Now that we install the python interpreter let us check it is installed well or not.
* Execute `CMD.EXE`. (`WindowsKey+R` and then type `cmd` and then `Enter` key) 

![00150 run cmd.exe](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00150.png)

* type `python -V` at command prompt. It must say `Python 3.7.3`.
* type `pip list` to list installed modules. Next shows the command and results.
> In example machine, the user name is `Administrator`. So the prompt shows `C:\Users\Administrator>`. If your user name is toor then then prompt will show `C:\Users\toor>`. 

```python
C:\Windows\system32>python -VPython 3.7.3C:\Windows\system32>pip listPackage    Version---------- -------pip        19.0.3setuptools 40.8.0
```

![00160 cmd.exe python check](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00160.png)

You installed `PyCharm IDE` and `Python Interpreter` to develop ARGOS-LABS RPA+. The installation is needed only once.

Next we will have some preparation process.

# Preparation

There are some needs to do before starting development. It is related to environmental configuration.

## Making Virtual Environment

VirtualEnv is the python's independent running environment. [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is one of such virtual environmental implementations.

You can make your own virtual environment as follows:

* Change into home folder using command: `cd %USERPROFILE%` at first.
* Create a new python virtual environment named `py3` using command: `python -m venv py3`
	* You can make venv as much as you want with different name.
	* You can change each venv.
	* `pip` is the python package manager.
	* venv, `py3` has some folders.
		* Scripts: some execuable files including `python.exe` and `pip.exe`.
		* Lib\site-packages:
			* If you install some third-party modules with `pip` then such modules will be located in this folder. (Some other platform use `dist-packages`)
			* If you install our plugin module using alabs.ppm (will explain later) then our plugin modules will be located in this folder.
* Change into this `py3` virtual environment using command: `py3\Scripts\activate`.
	* After changed into venv your prompt will be changed `C:\Users\user>` into `(py3) C:\Users\user>`. The prompt will be prefixed with `(name-of-venv) `.
	* At this virtual environment your installed modules including plugin programs are valid only at this virtual environment. This means each virtual environment has it's own running environment with dependent modules or plugins.
* `pip list` command shows the modules including plugins which are installed by `pip install ...` command.
	* `(py3) C:\Users\user>` prompt means `py3` virtual environment.
	* Every modules or plugins in `py3` venv are only valid on `py3` venv.

```python
C:\>cd %USERPROFILE%C:\Users\Administrator>python -m venv py3C:\Users\Administrator>py3\Scripts\activate(py3) C:\Users\Administrator>pip listPackage    Version---------- -------pip        19.0.3setuptools 40.8.0```

![00170 cmd python venv](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00170.png)

## Plugin Package Manager

### Enter Virtual Environment

Above `Making Virtual Environment` section shows how to make a new virtual environment named `py3`. Once the `py3` virtual environment is made, next time you just enter the virtual environment.

```python
C:\>cd %USERPROFILE%C:\Users\Administrator>py3\Scripts\activate(py3) C:\Users\Administrator>
```

Or directly the execute `activate`.

```python
C:\Users\Administrator>%USERPROFILE%\py3\scripts\activate(py3) C:\Users\Administrator>
```

When everything is done, you need to exit the virtual environment. you can do this `deactivate` command.

```python
(py3) C:\Users\Administrator>deactivateC:\Users\Administrator>
```

![00180 enter venv](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00180.png)

### Install `Plugin Package Manager`

Our plugin SDK include two parts.
* Plugin Package Manager named `alabs.ppm`
* Plugin library module named `alabs.common`

Next explanation is how to install `Plugin Package Manager`.
* You need command prompt which is entered virtual environment. You can refer above `Enter Virtual Environment` section.
* Install with command: `pip install -U alabs.ppm alabs.common --index http://pypi.argos-labs.com:8080 --trusted-host pypi.argos-labs.com`

```python

```
> `-U` or `--upgrade` option after `install` can upgrade to latest version.

![00190 install ppm](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00190.png)

### .argos-rpa.conf
`alabs.ppm` Plugin Package Manager use configuration file `.argos-rpa.conf` located in `C:\Users\Administrator` or `%USERPROFILE%`.

First create this file.
* In `CMD.EXE` prompt goto User folder with command `cd %USERPROFILE%`.
* Make and edit with `notepad .argos-rpa.conf`
> You can use explorer to create `.argos-rpa.conf` file.

![00200 cmd notepad](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00200.png)

The contents of configuration is:

``` yaml
---repository:  url: http://pypi.argos-labs.com:8080private-repositories:  - name: internal    url: http://10.211.55.2:48080    username: user1    password: pass_01
  - name: internal    url: http://10.211.55.3    username: user2    password: pass_02
```
> The configuration format is [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

* repository is the official plugin module by ARGOS-LABS.
	* url is the default address to access the office repository of ARGOS-LABS.
	* Do NOT change the `http://pypi.argos-labs.com:8080` without special reason.
* `private-repositories` can contain the list of private repositories.
	* You can biild your own private [pypiserver](https://github.com/pypiserver/pypiserver).
	* Each list item can have next four key:value pairs.
		* `name` is the unique name to use at `alabs.ppm`
		* `url` is the URL address to access your own private pypi server.
		* `username` and `password` is the user credential to upload to this pypiserver.
			* Currently private pypiserver support `htaccess` credential method.
			* If another credential method must be used then contact us.
> * If `alabs.ppm upload` command to upload plugin to private pypiserver is never used, then private-repositories can be empty.

The simplist form is:
``` yaml
---repository:  url: http://pypi.argos-labs.com:8080private-repositories:```

![00210 notepad .argos-rpa.conf](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00210.png)

### alabs.ppm
`alabs.ppm` plugin package manager has many command options.

* To begin with `CMD.EXE` enter virtual environment with command, `%USERPROFILE%\py3\Scripts\activate`
* `alabs.ppm` without any parameter says help output.

```python

# Development
Now that all kind of preparation is done, it is time to start development.

## Preparation of plugin development

Before starting plugin development there is no need all necessary files from the empty folder. We prepared the basic template `argos.demo.*` sample. This can be a good to use as a template.

### Copy from template

To download `argos.demo.*` template, first visit site `https://github.com/argos-labs/plugin-demo`.

![00240 visit https://github.com/argos-labs/plugin-demo](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00240.png)

Click the "Clone or download" and then click `Download ZIP` button.

![00250 download demo](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00250.png)

* If you unzip the downloaded zip then there is a folder named `plugin-demo-master`.
* Make a new folder `C:\work`.
* Move the folder `plugin-demo-master` into `C:\work`.

![00260 make work folder and move unzipped](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00260.png)

### Starting PyCharm

It is time to run PyCharm IDE.

* Double click the desktop's `JetBrains PyCharm ...` icon.
* After flash window there come up `Welcome to PyCharm` window.
* Select `Open`.

![00270 start pycharm](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00270.png)

* Select foler `C:\work\plugin-demo-master`.
* Click `OK` button.

![00280 select folder](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00280.png)

* Next captured image shows the opened status just after starting.

![00290 IDE starting screen](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00290.png)

### PyCharm Settings

Just after starting this project you have to do some settings.

* Open `File` menu and select `Settings...` or just type short-cut key `Ctrl+Alt+S`.

![00300 select settings](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00300.png)

Every project must have specific python interpreter.

* In `Settings` window, select `Project: plugin-demo-master` and then `Project Interpreter`.

![00310 settings project interpreter](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00310.png)

* To add interpreter click right-most icon at `Project Interpreter` row.
* Select `Add...`

![00320 add interpreter](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00320.png)

* Select `Existing environment`.
* Select `C:\Users\Administrator\py3\Scripts\python.exe`. (please replace `Administrator` with your own user id)
* Click `OK` button.

![00330 select interpreter](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00330.png)

After select `C:\Users\Administrator\py3\Scripts\python.exe` interpreter, there are `alabs.ppm` and `alabs.ppm` modules in module list.

![00340 project interpreter](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00340.png)

Next is optional options.

* In `Settings` windows search `right` keyword at secher input.
* In `Editor>Code Style` change `120` into `80` at `Hard wrap at` item.
> Python coding convention [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guides `80` columns for editing.
 
![00350 80 column](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00350.png)

* In `Settings` windows search `typo` keyword at secher input.
* In `Editor>Inspections` uncheck `Typo`. If you want only valid dictionary word at script then leave this item checked. 

![00360 uncheck typo](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00360.png)

# First Run / Debug

This `pluin-demo-master` project has two demo plugin: 

* `argoslabs\demo\helloworld`: The most simple but complete plugin sample.
* `argoslabs\demo\argtest`: The most complex user arguments sample.

Every plugin has it's own unittest.
Let's just debug the unittest for `argoslabs\demo\argtest`.

## Debug unittest

* Left panel show `Project` list.
* Double click `argoslabs\demo\helloworld\tests\test_me.py`.
* Then in editor pane `test_me.py` shows up.

![00370 select test_me.py](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00370.png)

* Right click `argoslabs\demo\helloworld\tests\test_me.py`.
* Select `Debug 'Unitests in test_me...'`.
* Then `Debug` pane comes up at bottom.

![00380 debug test_me.py](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00380.png)

* There are four unit tests.
* The result says, `Ran 4 tests in 0.028s. OK`

![00390 unittest](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00390.png)

> * Unittest must be implemented and file name must be starts with `test_`.
> * `alabs.ppm test` automatically run all test files starts with `test_`.

# Making New Plugin

It's time making a new plugin named `argoslabs.ai.tts`.
This plugin source is located in [https://github.com/argos-labs/plugin-tts](https://github.com/argos-labs/plugin-tts).

## Making proper python package

Let us categorize `argoslabs` / `ai` / `tts` that is to say `argoslabs.ai.tts`. Above `argoslabs.demo.helloworld` plugin has two python package `demo` and `helloworld`.

So next steps makeing `ai` and `tts` python package.

* To create a `ai` python package, right click the `argoslabs` folder at `Project` pane and then select `New>Python Package`.

![00400 new package](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00400.png)

* Type `ai` at `New Package` window. 
* Click `OK` button.

![00480 overwrite](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00480.png)

## __init__.py

Plugin's main script is located at `__init__.py` that python package so the file is `argoslabs\ai\tts\__init__.py`.

We can see the doc string from line 3 to 13 in `__init__.py` editor window.
And some comments from line 13 to 23. You can change any contents for this.

![00500 comments](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00500.png)

You can change the main function from `helloworld` into `do_tts`.

* Select by double click `helloworld` at line 33.
* Type `Shift+F6` keys.
* At `Rename` window type `do_tts`.
* Click `Refactor` button.

![00510 refactor](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00510.png)

* `Refactoring Preview` pane comes up at bottom side.
* Click `Do Refactor` button.

![00520 do refactor](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00520.png)

* At lines from 53 to 61 there is a instance definition of `ModuleContext` class with `with` clause.
* This `ModuleContext` class defines the plugin itself.
	* `owner` is the plugin owner. Official plugin's owner is `ARGOS-LABS`.
	* `group` is the group name for plugin.
	* `vresion` is the specific version.
	* `platform` defines the list of running platform.
		* `windows` is for Windows.
		* `darwin` is for Mac OS X.
		* `linux` is for Linux.
	* `output_type` is just for result type. Currently this option is not used any more.
	* `display_name` is the displayed name at `Stu`.
	* `icon_path` is the `icon.*` icon file folder. `get_icon_path(__file__)` is the defult with same folder with `__init__.py`.
	* `description` is the description.

![00530 ModuleContext](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00530.png)

## change icon

The `helloworld` default icon is:

![00540 default icon](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00540.png)

But we can change it with:

![00550 new icon](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00550.png)

> * Your plugin will be submitted to ARGOS-LABS plugin submitted repository.
> * The icon can be changed by ARGOS-LABS for consistency with other icons.

## prerequisite modues

We need some other modules already provided offcial [pypi repository](https://pypi.org).

### requirements.txt

In python prerequisite third party modules defined in [requirements.txt](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) file.

We add two prerequisite modues.

* `gTTS` module is for google TTS engine.
* `playsound` module is for play `mp3` or `wave` sound file.

![00560 requirements.txt](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00560.png)

### Install such prerequisite modues

You can install the prerequisite modues:

* Run `CMD.EXE` and enter virtual environment with command `py3\Scripts\activate`.
* Change into the plugin folder with command `cd \work\pluin-demo-master\argoslabs\ai\tts`.
* You can install modules with command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

![00570 install requirements.txt](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00570.png)

## Completion of __init__.py

Now you can complete the `__init__.py` script.

> You can get the complete `argoslabs.ai.tts` [source](https://github.com/argos-labs/plugin-tts).

`argoslabs.ai.tts` plugin takes 5 arguments, so we define 5 argument definition.
5 arguments consists three options and two parameters:

* There are three options.
	* `--save-mp3` or `-o` option is for saving result TTS `mp3` file at line 172 ~ 174. This option need filename to save.
	* `--lang` or `-l` option is for select the language used in TTS engine. Default is `en`, english. This argument need language made by two alphabet.
	* `--slow` or `-s` option is flag to say slowly or not. This option need no more argument.
* There are two parameters which means mandatory arguments at line 182 ~ 185.
	* `engine` argument must be defined. At this source only `google` is allowed.
	* `msg` argument must be defined for saying.

> * Above argument definition is the main key to use ARGOS-LABS RPA+ `Stu` program.
> * We explain it in detailed article. 

![00580 argument](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00580.png)

We complete the `do_tts` function at line 118~151.
> One of the main advantage using python is simple code than any other programming language.

![00590 do_tts](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00590.png)

## Unittest for plugin

You can edit test_me.py unittest file, `argoslabs\ai\tts\tests\test_me.py`.

### make your own unittest

* Edit top comments or doc string with your own information.

![00600 test_me](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00600.png)

Then we can define each unittest functions like `testnnnn_...`:

* `test0100_empty_parameter`: empty user argument make error, exception.
* `test0110_unknown_engine`: other than `google` engine make error, exception.
* `test0120_missing_msg `: without `msg` parameter make error, exception.
* `test0200_say_hello`: say "Hello world?" in english.
* `test0210_say_hello_slow`: say "Hello world?" in english more slowly.
* `test0250_say_hello_ko`: say some words in korean.
* `test0260_say_hello_ja`: say some words in japaneese.
* `test0270_say_hello_zh_cn`: say some words in chineese.
* `test0300_say_hello_save_mp3` and `test0310_say_hello_save_mp3`: say some words in english and keep it with `mp3` file.

> The more unittest make the program more robust moreover when you add new feature all previous unittest used as regression test.

![00610 test_me second page](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00610.png)

### debug unittest

You can debug the `test_me.py` unittest.

* Right click the `test_me.py` file and then select `Debug 'Unittests in test_me...'`.

![00630 debug test_me](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00630.png)

* `Debug` pane comes up bottom side.
* Left `Test Results` says the reuslt of all unittest.
* Keep debugging the unittest until every unittest is passed.

![00640 debugging test_me](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00640.png)

## configuration of plugin

`setup.yaml` is the configuration of plugin.
This is related with [setup.py specification](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/).
> Note. Be careful with `argoslabs.ai.tts` before `['icon.*']`. Copyed contents is `argoslabs.demo.helloworld`. If this name is not matched the icon will not show.

![00650 ](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00650.png)

# build and submit

Once you finished the `__init__.py` main script and `test_me.py` unittest. It's time to build and submit.

## Edit build.bat

All of these job can be run by `build.bat` in Windows using `alabs.pps` plugin package manager.

* `alabs.ppm --venv test` will test all test scripts starts with `test`.
	* `--venv` make the new temporary virtual environment at `%USERPROFILE%\py.windows`.
	* Using this venv every dependent modules are installed from the clean environment.
	* If any unittest is not ok, then exit with `test have error` message. 
	
```bat
REM test
alabs.ppm --venv %VB% test
IF NOT %ERRORLEVEL% == 0 (
	echo "test have error"
    goto errorExit
)
```

* `alabs.ppm --venv build` will build release type of `wheel`.
	* If build command failed, then exit with `build have error` message. 

```bat
REM # build
alabs.ppm --venv %VB% build
IF NOT %ERRORLEVEL% == 0 (
	echo "build have error"
    goto errorExit
)
```

* `alabs.ppm --venv submit` will submit zipped plugin to ARGOS-LABS plugin upload server.
	* Your uploaded zipped plugin can be a candidate of official ARGOS-LABS plugin available to all users.
	* Your candidate code will be scanned and checked with any security issue or harmful code.
	* If your candidate passed then your plugin published to official plugin repository, `pypi.argos-labs.com`.
	* You can skip this `submit` process, instead you can upload this plugin to your own private pypi server and the result is noticed to you by email which is described at `setup.yaml`.
	* If submit command failed, then exit with `submit have error` message. 

```bat
REM # submit to repository
alabs.ppm %VB% submit
IF NOT %ERRORLEVEL% == 0 (
	echo "submit have error"
    goto errorExit
)
```

* `alabs.ppm --venv upload` will upload your plugin release to your private pypi server.
	* If there is no parameter after upload then then first item at `private-repositories` list at `.argos-rpa.conf` file.
	* If you want choose one private pypi server then `name` item will be followed after upload command.
	* You can use your own plugin for your site only with at your own risk. 

```bat
REM # upload to private repository
alabs.ppm --venv %VB% upload
IF NOT %ERRORLEVEL% == 0 (
	echo "upload have error"
    goto errorExit
)
```

> * You can edit your build.bat. If you do not know well then just use this `build.bat`.
> * In Mac OS X or Linux platform you can use `build.sh`.

![00660 build.bat](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00660.png)

## Run the build.bat

You can run the `build.bat`.

* Run `CMD.EXE` and enter `py3` virtual environment.
* Go to the `tts` folder.
* Run the `build.bat`

```python
C:\>%USERPROFILE%\py3\Scripts\activate(py3) C:\>cd \work\plugin-demo-master\argoslabs\ai\tts(py3) C:\work\plugin-demo-master\argoslabs\ai\tts>build.bat
```

![00010 clean up windows 10 desktop](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00670.png)

A few minites later you can see `"Build all success!"`. Then all is done for your side.

![00010 clean up windows 10 desktop](https://argos-labs.github.io/images/gst-captures/00680.png)

Good luck!
